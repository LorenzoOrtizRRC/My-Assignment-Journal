Father lost. His large figure, in dragonoid form, pinned down by great white spears. We witnessed his final fight from the fortress,
where force from their battles shook the walls and the earth, yet if a dragon cannot stand against the gods, what hope have we left?
My uneasy mind had regretted our desperate last resistance in the north. Perhaps if we fled away…

One has landed in the middle of the courtyard. Four pairs of wings on his back, and a scroll on his hand.
He unraveled it and began to speak, while myself and my knights were unable to approach him. We could only look.

He announced Father’s sacrifice, and that he was to be an offering. He mentioned the group of visitors we had sent out,
the advance party no doubt, and that they were well received. He offered us his meaning of mercy: a surrender to a quick death.
Unacceptable. I tried my utmost to lash out even a weak voice from where I stood, but I could do nothing but watch as it flew away.
It gave us a date of reckoning, that is, tomorrow.

I visited my betrothed Auria and my little brother Lyn, who came with me northwards. We had discussed plans, our convictions, resolutions,
anything to take this burden off my mind even just for a moment. Auria has almost reached the level of a grand mage, and Lyn is one of the greatest minds in the continent,
perhaps the greatest one of all. We will work out a solution for the cataclysm that will soon befall us this coming dawn.
