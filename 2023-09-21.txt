In honor of High Prince Zephyr, the last light of Einhart, Dame Auria, who reached Grand Mage at the pinnacle of battle and betrothed to Zephyr, and King Artorias, last king of Einhart.

Zephyr and his comrades at arms had formed our last line of defense. Hereon, title, wealth, bloodline, nothing else matters except your identity as people of Einhart.
I watched as our brave knights had battled the grotesque aberrations from heaven. As the last knight fell, and brother Zephyr stood alone,
his back protecting us, the common people had picked up their blades in support of him.

I was able to secretly flee. As I looked back, I saw my brother’s body lifted up with gigantic white spears.
From him came forth bursts of mana that manifested into a ghostly temple in the clouds, like how they did to Father. I could only keep going forward.
This task entrusted to me by my brother, to simply live. I will not allow it. I will do more, and bring you to justice, dear brother.

I write this journal down as proof of my family’s resolution. Our family is strong. Our kingdom is strong. Our people are strong. The name Einheart will continue to live on.

In honor of brother’s sacrifice, the gods will fall.

Lyn Einhart.

[RESEARCH NOTES]
- The Lyn from the journal is the Ruined King Koross.
- The final temple that appeared seems to be the Temple of Twilight, destroyed by the Ruined King about 200 cycles ago. Precise time impossible to decipher.
- Hypothesis: Zephyr's body is possessed by the Ruined King, seeing as the Temple of Twilight hadn't been restored. Could he be attempting to revive his brother's body?
- It seems the Ruined King has what I want. But I prepare more before advancing to the next stage.
